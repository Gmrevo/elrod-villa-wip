Sample Vacation Rental Info/Concierge Chatbot for Alexa

This is a sample Alexa skill that implments a chatbot suitable for deployment in a vacation rental. It is customized to my own vacation rental, Elrod Villa (http://www.evillapalmsprings.com), but could be used as a model for similar custom skills.  All Alexa spoken content is currently contained in the index file, but should probably be implemented in a different fashion (fetched from a remote location, perhaps?) to facilitate easier updating.

This example shows a way of handling both simple and multi-turn dialogs. In this sample, recommendations for restaurants, bars, and local attractions are handled as multi-turn dialogs.
